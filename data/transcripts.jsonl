The B2 consists of five parts. The B2 tip, the B2 stem, a condenser, a screen, and of course, a Dynavap cap. Let's take a look at some of the updates to our entry-level thermal extraction device. The B2's stainless steel tip now holds about 50% more than our original B. Also, we've updated the silicone stem with a larger grip. The B2 comes in our new tin case and includes our brand new single-flame Dynatorch. Everything you need to get started. Broccoli not included. The B2 is also compatible with a 10mm water piece and fits with Dynavap tips as well as into your sling stash. In conclusion, with its stainless steel tip and intuitive design, the B2 is a great entry-level device to get into the Dynaverse. What do you think about the B2? Let us know in the comments. We'd love to hear from you."}]}
